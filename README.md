Easel is a library for building interactive 2D content in HTML5. It is based on [CreateJS/EaselJS](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) but implemented in TypeScript and with slightly better performances.

This reimplementation of CreateJS was done to be included in a personal project that aimed to be mainly made in TypeScript. It works well alone or with Create2D/Tween for animations.

It has no external dependencies and should be compatible with virtually any framework you enjoy using.

The functions are the same as CreateJS/EaselJS, but this implementation of Easel may be not compatible with the CreateJS suite.
